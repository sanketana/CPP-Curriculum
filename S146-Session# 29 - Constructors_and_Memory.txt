Concepts
=========
1. Constructors in Detail
   - Default constructor
   - Parameterized constructor
   - Copy constructor
   - Constructor overloading
   - Constructor initialization lists

2. Destructors
   - What are destructors
   - When are they called
   - Why we need them
   - Virtual destructors (brief introduction)

3. Memory Management
   - Stack vs Heap memory
   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - Memory leaks
   - The 'new' and 'delete' operators
   - Arrays and dynamic memory

Classwork
=========
1. Point Class Example
   - Multiple constructors
   - Deep vs Shallow copy
   - Memory management

2. Dynamic Array Class
   - Constructor with dynamic array
   - Destructor to free memory
   - Copy constructor
   - Resizing array

Homework
=========
1. String Class Implementation
   - Create a basic String class
   - Implement constructors and destructor
   - Handle dynamic memory for characters

2. Matrix Class
   - 2D dynamic array implementation
   - Proper memory management
   - Copy constructor

Additional Practice
=========
1. Smart Pointers introduction (if time permits)
2. Rule of Three concept
