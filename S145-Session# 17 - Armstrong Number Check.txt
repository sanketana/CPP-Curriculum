🚀 Exercise 2: Armstrong Number Check

Problem:
Write a C++ program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
Example:
	•	Input: 153 → 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 → ✅ Armstrong Number
	•	Input: 123 → ❌ Not an Armstrong Number

Problem Statement: Strong Number Check (C++)

Write a C++ program to check whether a given number is a Strong Number or not.
A Strong Number is a number where the sum of the factorials of its digits equals the original number itself.

Explanation:

A number is said to be a Strong Number if:


\text{sum of factorials of its digits} = \text{the number itself}


For example:
145 is a strong number because:
	•	1! = 1
	•	4! = 24
	•	5! = 120

Sum of factorials: 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 ✅
