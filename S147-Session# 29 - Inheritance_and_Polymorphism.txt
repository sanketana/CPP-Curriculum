Concepts
=========
1. Inheritance Basics
   - What is inheritance?
   - Base and Derived classes
   - Access specifiers in inheritance (public, private, protected)
   - Types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel)

2. Polymorphism
   - Function overriding
   - Virtual functions
   - Pure virtual functions
   - Abstract classes
   - Virtual destructors

3. Method Access and Inheritance
   - Method hiding
   - Using override keyword
   - Using final keyword
   - Protected members
   - Friend functions

Classwork
=========
1. Shape Hierarchy Example
   - Base class: Shape
   - Derived classes: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle
   - Virtual area() and perimeter() functions

2. Animal Sound Example
   - Base class: Animal
   - Derived classes: Dog, Cat, Duck
   - Virtual makeSound() function

Homework
=========
1. Vehicle Management System
   - Base class: Vehicle
   - Derived classes: Car, Motorcycle, Truck
   - Track fuel, speed, maintenance

2. Employee Payroll System
   - Base class: Employee
   - Derived classes: Manager, Developer, Intern
   - Calculate salary based on role
