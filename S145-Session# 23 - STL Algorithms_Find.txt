Concepts
=========
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides a rich set of algorithms that operate 
on containers like vectors, lists, and sets. These algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> and <numeric> 
headers and cover operations like searching, sorting, modifying, and numerical computations.

Category	        Examples
Non-Modifying	    all_of, find, count, for_each
Modifying	        copy, replace, fill, remove
Sorting & Searching	sort, stable_sort, binary_search
Numeric	            accumulate, iota, inner_product
Set Operations	    set_union, set_intersection
Heap	            make_heap, push_heap, pop_heap

Most Common and Useful Algorithms
=================================
Sort - Fast sorting (O(n log n))
Find - Finding an element in an unsorted container
Binary Search - Finding an element in a sorted container
Accumulate

Reverse
Copy / Copy If
Remove / Remove if / Erase
