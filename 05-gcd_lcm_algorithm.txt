example

Num1 = 48
Num2 = 18
GCD = 6
Formula: 

Solution 1 - Prime factorization
18 = 2^2 * 3^1
48 = 2^4 * 3^1

common factors are: 2*3 = 6

Solution 2 - Euclid's division method
The Euclidean method is an efficient way to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Here’s how it works:

Steps to Find the GCD Using the Euclidean Method

	1.	Identify the two numbers, say a and b, where a > b.
	2.	Divide a by b, and find the remainder, which we’ll call r.
	•	If the remainder r is 0, then b is the GCD of the original pair.
	•	If r is not 0, then replace a with b, and b with r.
	3.	Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. When you reach a remainder of 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD.

Example

Let’s find the GCD of 48 and 18.
	1.	￼, ￼
	2.	Divide 48 by 18:
￼
So, ￼, ￼ (we replace a with b and b with the remainder).
	3.	Divide 18 by 12:
￼
Now, ￼, ￼.
	4.	Divide 12 by 6:
￼
Here, the remainder is 0, so our divisor at this step, which is 6, is the GCD.

Answer

The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6.

Python Code

Here’s a simple Python code to find the GCD using the Euclidean method:

def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Example usage:
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6

This code will give you the GCD of any two positive integers you input by following the Euclidean algorithm.
