Exercise# 1
Pointer vs Reference

Problem Statement:

Create a program that demonstrates the differences between a pointer and a reference:
	1.	Create an integer variable x and assign it a value.
	2.	Create a pointer p and a reference r to x.
	3.	Modify the value of x using both the pointer and the reference.
Print the modified values after each operation.
