This lesson plan will demonstrate:

Different types of iterators
Common iterator operations
Practical examples with various containers
Iterator categories and their capabilities
60-STL_Iterators.cpp
This code provides:

Basic iterator usage and syntax
Different iterator categories (forward, bidirectional, random access)
Common iterator operations (advance, next, prev)
Constant iterators for read-only access
Reverse iterators for backward traversal
Iterator distance calculation
Key teaching points:

Iterators are the glue between containers and algorithms
Different containers support different types of iterators
Iterator categories determine what operations are possible
Safety features like const_iterator
Common patterns and best practices for iterator usage
